## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Crop Recommendation System documentation. This system is designed to empower farmers by providing data-driven recommendations for crop selection, based on the comprehensive analysis of environmental and soil conditions.

## 2. Features

The Crop Recommendation System offers a range of powerful features to assist farmers:

- **Data Loading**: Seamlessly import agricultural data from Google Sheets.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Explore your data with ease through interactive charts and visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict crop suitability using machine learning models.
- **Data Update Functionality**: Effortlessly update Google Sheets data from within the system.

## 3. Demo
The demo showcases the system's capabilities and user interface. It can be found in the notebook file.

## 4. Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.x**: You must have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **Google Sheets Document**: Access to a Google Sheets document containing agricultural data.
- **Python Libraries**: Install the required Python libraries specified in the project code.

## 5. Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`

## 6. Configuration

To configure the system:

Obtain a JSON key file for Google Sheets API authentication.
Specify the path to the JSON key file in the code to enable authentication.

## 7. Usage Guide
### 7.1. Data Loading and Analysis
Load data from the Google Sheets document into a pandas DataFrame.
Conduct detailed data analysis and exploration to gain insights into dataset structure and content.
Utilize histograms, bar plots, and heat maps for data visualization.
