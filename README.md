# Middle Python Developer (Machine Learning/AI) Test

This repository contains the solutions to the Middle Python Developer (Machine Learning/AI) Test, which includes tasks related to creating a neural network, working with databases, integrating with a Google API, and providing comprehensive documentation.

## Task 1: Creating a Neural Network

### Overview
In this task, I created a custom neural network using TensorFlow to classify images from the MNIST dataset. The network was trained, and its performance was evaluated.

### Implementation
- Created a neural network with two hidden layers.
- Utilized TensorFlow as the machine learning framework.
- Trained the network on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy and loss metrics.

### Code and Results
- Neural Network Code

## Task 2: Working with Databases

### Overview
For this task, I created a simple SQLite3 database and wrote a Python script to interact with it. The script can perform data operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

### Implementation
- Created an SQLite database using Python's built-in SQLite library.
- Implemented functions for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Organized the database with tables for efficient data management.

### Code and Documentation
- Database Script
- Database

## Task 3: Integration with a Google Spreadsheet API

### Overview
In this task, I wrote a Python script to interact with a Google Spreadsheet API (Google Sheets API). The script can send requests to the API and process the received data.

### Implementation
- Used the `gspread` library to access Google Sheets.
- Sent requests to the Google Sheets API to retrieve and update data.
- Processed data from the API for further analysis.

### Code and Documentation
- Google Spreadsheet API Script

## Task 4: Documentation

### Overview
This task involved creating comprehensive documentation for each of the previous tasks. The documentation explains the capabilities of the code, installation, usage, and other important details for users.

## Conclusion
This repository contains the completed tasks for the Middle Python Developer (Machine Learning/AI) Test. Each task is well-documented, and the code is organized and adheres to best software development practices.
